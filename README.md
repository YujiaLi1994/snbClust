# snbClust
The package snbClust contains the code for Sparse Negative Binomial Mixture Model for Clustering RNA-seq Count Data. 
The sparse gaussian mixture model of Pan and Shen (2007) is also included in this package as a comparison.
The five R script contains all the simulation example and real data example in the following paper: 
Rahman, Tanbin, et al. "A sparse negative binomial mixture model for clustering RNA-seq count data." arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.02399 (2019).

For installation, we recommend to unzip the tar.gz file first and then use devtools::install() to install the package.
